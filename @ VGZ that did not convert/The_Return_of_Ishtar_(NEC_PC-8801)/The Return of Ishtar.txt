Notes:
Track names (except 14 and 15) are from the
official The Return of Ishtar original
soundtrack released on iTunes by
Bandai Namco Entertainment.

Both tracks 14 and 15 are exclusive to the
PC88 and PC98 versions of the game, while
track 14 is also available in the Sharp X1
version of the game running without the YM2151
sound expansion. Both seems to be related with
some anti-piracy routine, but is unknown how
they are triggered.
