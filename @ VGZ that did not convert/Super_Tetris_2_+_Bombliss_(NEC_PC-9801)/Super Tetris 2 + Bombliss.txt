Notes:
Logged with Neko Project 21 VGM mod.  The game
has a hidden sound test (run MUSIC TEST at the
DOS prompt) which was used to access all the
music.

This game is a semi-port of Super Tetris 2 +
Bombliss from the Super Famicom.  In-game it
only calls itself Tetris 2 + Bombliss, but the
packaging and manual retain the "Super".  All
the music from the SFC version is present here,
but a few are not used in-game and have been
marked as such.

Stangely, this version has no credits
whatsoever so I am not 100% sure about the
music credits.  I have based them on the SFC
version and added Yasuhiro Taguchi who is
credited (under his alias Dougen Shibuya) for
the PC-98 driver in the sound test (it's likely
he did the PC-98 music conversions).

It is also possible that BPS did not develop
this version directly - the original SFC
version was done by TOSE but they aren't listed
anywhere in this one so it's hard to say.
