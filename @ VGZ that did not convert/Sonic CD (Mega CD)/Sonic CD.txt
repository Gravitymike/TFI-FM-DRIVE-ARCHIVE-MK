Notes:
There are 2 playlists.
The "All Tunes" playlist plays all tunes
(ordered like above, but past-tunes follow the
present-ones.
The normal playlist plays only the complete
tracks (all past-tunes).

The files were compressed with OptVgmRF.
Size reduction: 140.59 MB -> 7.70 MB (5.5 %)

Ripping wasn't that hard. The unused/incomplete
tunes were ripped by chaning the filename of
the SNCBNK??.BIN files.

You'll notice that the SNCBNK2?.BIN files were
not ripped, but most of you already know that
these numbers are leftovers of the deleted
R2 zone.
