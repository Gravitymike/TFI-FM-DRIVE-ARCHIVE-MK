Notes:
The game is an adult visual novel that is based
on adult 1984's anime called
"Superdimension SF Legend Rall".

The music is what you would expect from Ryu
Umemoto and alternate between real bangers and
more emotional music with pads and bells.

Some songs also got an SC-55 MIDI version that
I can recommend as well. It's just a pity that
only 5 of the 12 songs got MIDI versions.


Fun fact: According to Mobygames, the heroine
is unable to lose any of the battles. I guess
that's the reason the battle theme is called
"Winning Expectation".



Songs were logged using Neko Project 21 VGM mod
by playing back the .M files using the
game's sound driver (PMD 4.7g) and Kajihara's
PMP tool.
I used pmd2mid to help identifing the loop
points. I still had to do some fine-tuning due
to vibrato affecting notes during their release
phase, which often was still ongoing when the
internal loop happened.

The song order is a very rough guess about how
the songs could appear in the game.

Each of the .M files's notes section contains
also the following copyright notices:
  (C)Zero One
  (R)Staff "Y-arm"
